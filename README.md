## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device not found:**
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled
- Check USB cable connection
- Try different USB port
- Accept ADB debugging prompt on device

**Messages app not opening:**
- Verify Google Messages is installed
- Set Google Messages as default SMS app
- Close other messaging apps

**Script can't find UI elements:**
- Ensure device screen is on and unlocked
- Check if Google Messages UI has changed
- Try updating the script to latest version

**Messages not sending:**
- Verify sufficient SMS credit/plan
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure phone numbers are valid
- Try sending manually first

### Error Recovery

The script includes robust error handling:
- Automatic retries for failed operations
- Navigation recovery on UI errors
- Detailed error logging
- Graceful fallback to hardware keys

## Limitations

- Requires physical device connection via USB
- Works specifically with Google Messages app
- Depends on UI element stability (may break with app updates)
- No support for multimedia messages (MMS)
- Rate limited by carrier SMS restrictions

## Legal Considerations

- Ensure compliance with local SMS/messaging laws
- Respect recipient consent and privacy
- Follow carrier terms of service
- Consider anti-spam regulations
- Use responsibly for legitimate purposes only
